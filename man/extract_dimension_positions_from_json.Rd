\title{Extract Dimension Positions from JSON Response}
\usage{
extract_dimension_positions_from_json(json_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{json_data}{Parsed JSON from datastructure endpoint (as list)}
}
\value{
Named integer vector mapping dimension IDs to their 1-based
positions (e.g., \code{c(FREQ = 1L, REF_AREA = 2L, EDITION = 7L)}).
Returns an empty named integer vector on error.
}
\description{
Internal function to extract dimension IDs and their 1-based key positions
from the JSON datastructure response. SDMX positions are 0-based, so this
function adds 1 to convert them. If a dimension does not declare a position,
the iteration index is used as fallback.
