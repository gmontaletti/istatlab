\title{Build SDMX Positional Filter Key}
\usage{
build_sdmx_filter_key(n_dims, dim_values)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_dims}{Integer. Total number of dimensions in the dataset.
Must be a positive integer.}

\item{dim_values}{Named list mapping dimension positions (as character strings)
to filter values. Position numbering starts at 1. For example,
\code{list("1" = "M", "7" = "G_2024_01")} sets dimension 1 to \code{"M"}
and dimension 7 to \code{"G_2024_01"}.}
}
\value{
Character string containing the dot-separated filter key.
}
\description{
Constructs a dot-separated positional filter key for SDMX API queries.
The ISTAT SDMX API uses positional filters where each dimension is separated
by a dot. Empty positions act as wildcards (match all values). For example,
a dataset with 8 dimensions and a filter key \code{"M......G_2024_01."} means
dimension 1 is \code{"M"}, dimension 7 is \code{"G_2024_01"}, and all other
dimensions are unrestricted.
}
\examples{
# Set dimension 1 to "M" and dimension 7 to "G_2024_01" in an 8-dimension dataset
build_sdmx_filter_key(8, list("1" = "M", "7" = "G_2024_01"))
# Returns: "M......G_2024_01."

# Single dimension filter
build_sdmx_filter_key(5, list("3" = "IT"))
# Returns: "..IT.."

# All wildcards (equivalent to "ALL")
build_sdmx_filter_key(4, list())
# Returns: "..."
}
