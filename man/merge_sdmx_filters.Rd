\title{Merge Dimension Values into an Existing SDMX Filter}
\usage{
merge_sdmx_filters(base_filter, n_dims, dim_values)
}
\arguments{
\item{base_filter}{Character string with an existing dot-separated filter,
or \code{NULL} / \code{"ALL"} to indicate no existing filter.}

\item{n_dims}{Integer. Total number of dimensions in the dataset.}

\item{dim_values}{Named list mapping dimension positions (as character strings)
to filter values. Same format as in \code{\link{build_sdmx_filter_key}}.
Values are only inserted into positions that are empty (wildcard) in
\code{base_filter}; existing user-specified values are preserved.}
}
\value{
Character string containing the merged dot-separated filter key.
}
\description{
Takes an existing SDMX filter string and fills in additional dimension values
without overwriting positions already specified by the user. When the base
filter is \code{NULL} or \code{"ALL"}, a new filter key is built from scratch
using \code{\link{build_sdmx_filter_key}}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Fill position 7 into an 8-dimension filter that has positions 1 and 3 set
merge_sdmx_filters("M..IT.....", 8, list("7" = "G_2024_01"))
# Returns: "M..IT....G_2024_01."

# User-specified values are not overwritten
merge_sdmx_filters("M..IT.....", 8, list("1" = "Q", "7" = "G_2024_01"))
# Returns: "M..IT....G_2024_01." (position 1 keeps "M", not overwritten)

# NULL base_filter builds from scratch
merge_sdmx_filters(NULL, 8, list("1" = "M", "7" = "G_2024_01"))
# Returns: "M......G_2024_01."
